PICO will generate a rich and unique catalog of hundreds of thousands of new sources serving astrophysicists across a broad range of interests including in galaxy and cluster evolution, correlations of cold galactic dust with galaxy properties, the physics of jets in active galactic nuclei, and the properties of the cosmic infrared background. This information will be embedded in catalogs including 50,000 proto-clusters extending to $z\simeq 4.5$, 4,500 strongly lensed galaxies extending to $z\simeq 5$, 30,000 galaxies with $z\leq 0.1$, polarization data for few thousand radio sources and dust galaxies, and the deepest maps of the CIB with as high a resolution as 1 arcmin .
