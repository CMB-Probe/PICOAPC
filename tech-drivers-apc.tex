The remaining technology developments required to enable the PICO baseline design are: \\
$\bullet$ \hspace{0.05in} extension of three-color antenna-coupled bolometers down to 21\,GHz and up to 462\,GHz; \\
$\bullet$ \hspace{0.05in} construction of high-frequency direct absorbing arrays and laboratory testing; \\
$\bullet$ \hspace{0.05in} beam line and 100\,mK testing to simulate the cosmic ray environment at L2; and \\
$\bullet$ \hspace{0.05in} implementation of time-domain multiplexing to support 128 switched rows per readout column. \\
All of these developments are straightforward extensions of technologies already available and used today by sub-orbital and orbital experiments.  We recommend APRA and SAT funding to complete the development through the milestones described in Table~\ref{tab:technologies}~\citep{pico_report}.
