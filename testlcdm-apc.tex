The current host of cosmological observations including the CMB fit within the $\Lambda$CDM model, but they have statistical strength to constrain only six of more than a dozen known cosmological parameters. A figure of merit (FOM) that quantifies the strength of the constraint is the volume of the uncertainty region in the $N$-dimensional parameter space~\citep{core_parameter,Wang2008,pdg2018,Namikawa2010}. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:fom} shows the increase in the FOM since \cobe\ for the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as for additional cosmological parameters. The Figure only includes data from CMB experiments. The FOM for $\Lambda$CDM improved by a factor of 100 between {\it WMAP} and \planck , and will further improve by a factor of $10^{5}$ with PICO. For the 11-parameter set that includes $\Neff$ shown in the Figure PICO will improve upon \planck\ by a factor of $0.5\times10^{9}$. Having achieved this improvement, there would be only little information left to extract with this parameter set even by a mission with double the resolution and nearly ten times lower noise (Fig.~\ref{fig:fom}). Even stronger FOM improvements are obtained when a 12-parameter set is considered~\citep{picoweb_lcdm}, and when the PICO CMB data will be combined with data sets available in the next decade, including weak lensing, BAO, and cluster of galaxies.

\caption{\captiontext 
The increase in the FOM using data from CMB experiments since \cobe\ for the $\Lambda$CDM six-parameter model (dark purple) and when adding other cosmological parameters.  Increase in value represents increase in information content. PICO data will continue the average trend (blue line, $\Lambda$CDM + $\alpha_{1}$) of doubling the FOM every 10 months since 1992. For an 11-parameter set that includes $\Neff$ (red increasing line) PICO will improve the FOM by a factor of $0.5\times10^{9}$ relative to \planck , and will extract nearly the same information as that attainable by a mission with double the resolution and nine times lower baseline noise (top right red horizontal bar). The 11-parameter set includes: $w$-dark energy; $r$-the tensor to scalar ratio; $\alpha_{1}$-amplitude of correlated CDM isocurvature perturbations; $\Omega_{k}$-curvature; $\Neff$-effective number of light relics; $\sum m_{\nu}$-sum of neutrino masses; and $d\ln n_{s}/d\ln k$-running of the spectral index.
